starphleet.headquarters
=======================

Sample headquarters repository we use for testing.

This is set with pushback, so if you want that to work, you will need to fork
and use a git remote as the `headquarters <url>`. But, no big worry, it'll work otherwise
just will fail to push back changes to the headquarters that are made locally.

More nuts.
